Overview:
This Unity project contains two primary scripts demonstrating scene management and data passing between scenes using a static variable. It simulates a basic multiplayer lobby system where a player enters their name in the lobby scene, then joins a room scene where that name is displayed.

Scripts:
1. LobbyScene.cs
- Contains TMP_InputField for player name input.
- Saves player name as a static string.
- Loads the Room Scene upon successful name entry.

2. RoomScene.cs
- Displays the player name retrieved from the LobbyScene static variable.
- Contains logic to spawn rotating cubes randomly within a specified range.
- Includes a toggle button to switch microphone icons and simulate voice on/off.

Setup Instructions:
- Include TMPro package for input fields and UI text.
- Assign UI components to public variables in Inspector (e.g., playerNameInput, playernameText, voiceButton).
- Create scenes named exactly as "Lobby Scene" and "Room Scene" and add them to Build Settings.
- Link cubePrefab and sprite assets for voice buttons in RoomScene.

Key Features:
- Static variable usage for transferring player data between scenes.
- SceneManager for scene loading.
- UI interaction with buttons and input fields.
- Basic random positioning and rotation of game objects.
- Debug logging for process verification.

Usage:
- Run the Lobby Scene.
- Enter a player name in the input field.
- Click Join Room to load Room Scene.
- Player name will show on UI text.
- Use Spawn Cube button to instantiate rotating cubes randomly.
- Use Voice On/Off button to toggle voice status icon.

Notes:
- The playerName variable is static and accessible throughout scene transitions.
- Ensure UI references are assigned properly in the Inspector to avoid null reference errors.
